      <description>After many sessions with researchers. We are delighted to sum up the major feedback we gathered during demonstrations of the alpha.
Privacy of data is paramount especially when the researchers are working with measurement derived from human subjectsThe methodology approaches are just as important as the tool (i.e. knowing what to do with the tool as opposed what the features the tool offers)Open source of methodology code is non-negotiable for many of the researchersStay tuned to see who we digest this and use it to put some cool features into the beta version.</description>

      <description>The data deluge has arrived. It is here to stay. We aim to provide you with the cloud tools necessary to capitalise on this vast amount of information. Tercen is here to help others use their data more effectively and ultimately help them get back into control. Once data control is restored then actionable insights will follow. I hope you stay tuned to what we are doing at Tercen and try some of our exciting and free online cloud tools.</description>
