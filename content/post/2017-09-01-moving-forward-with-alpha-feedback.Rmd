After many sessions with researchers. We are delighted to sum up the major feedback we gathered during demonstrations of the __alpha__.

* Privacy of data is paramount especially when the researchers are working with measurement derived from human subjects
* The methodology approaches are just as important as the tool (i.e. knowing what to do with the tool as opposed what the features the tool offers)
* Open source of methodology code is non-negotiable for many of the researchers

Stay tuned to see who we digest this and use it to put some cool features into the __beta version__.
