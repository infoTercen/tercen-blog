<p>After many sessions with researchers. We are delighted to sum up the major feedback we gathered during demonstrations of the <strong>alpha</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy of data is paramount especially when the researchers are working with measurement derived from human subjects</li>
<li>The methodology approaches are just as important as the tool (i.e.Â knowing what to do with the tool as opposed what the features the tool offers)</li>
<li>Open source of methodology code is non-negotiable for many of the researchers</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned to see who we digest this and use it to put some cool features into the <strong>beta version</strong>.</p>
