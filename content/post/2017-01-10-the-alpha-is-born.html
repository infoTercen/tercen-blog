<p>After working throughout 2016. We have a great <strong>alpha</strong> version of the Tercen Cloud. We focussed on issues which researchers face day to day when dealing with large amount of data.</p>
<p>We are very proud to deliver the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive multi-dimensional visuals</li>
<li>Workflow editor</li>
<li>A new visual for pairwise plots called <strong>multi-pairwise</strong></li>
<li>A wizard to help researchers perform workflows</li>
<li>A <code>rtercen</code> R library</li>
<li>Ability to organize researchers into <strong>Projects</strong> and <strong>Teams</strong></li>
<li>An up-to-date cloud-base architecture using <strong>docker</strong>, <strong>CouchDB</strong> and <strong>cephFS</strong></li>
<li>A invitation system for new users</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>alpha</strong> version allows us to demo the concepts and go out to the researchers and hear what they say about the approach. This feedback is valuable and is the major input for our <strong>beta</strong> (scheduled begining of 2018).</p>
